## Review Models

### Double-Blind Peer Review (Primary Model)

#### Process Description
- **Author Anonymity**: Author identities hidden from reviewers
- **Reviewer Anonymity**: Reviewer identities hidden from authors
- **Objective Evaluation**: Focus on content quality rather than author reputation
- **Bias Reduction**: Minimizes potential for bias based on author characteristics

#### Implementation
- **Manuscript Preparation**: Authors must prepare anonymized versions
- **Reviewer Assignment**: Reviewers selected without knowledge of authorship
- **Communication**: All communications maintain anonymity
- **Decision Communication**: Final decisions communicated without revealing reviewer identities

#### Benefits
- **Reduced Bias**: Minimizes bias based on author reputation, affiliation, or demographics
- **Fair Evaluation**: Equal treatment regardless of author seniority or institutional prestige
- **Honest Feedback**: Reviewers more likely to provide candid, constructive criticism
- **Quality Focus**: Evaluation based purely on scientific merit

### Single-Blind Peer Review

#### When Used
- **Technical Notes**: For brief technical communications
- **Invited Articles**: When authors are specifically invited
- **Special Circumstances**: When double-blind review is not feasible

#### Process
- **Reviewer Anonymity**: Reviewer identities remain hidden from authors
- **Author Transparency**: Authors' identities known to reviewers
- **Modified Standards**: Adapted review criteria when appropriate

### Open Peer Review (Optional)

#### Pilot Program
- **Voluntary Participation**: Authors may opt-in to open review
- **Transparency**: Reviewer names and comments made public
- **Post-Publication**: Reviews published alongside accepted articles
- **Innovation**: Exploring new models of scholarly communication

#### Benefits
- **Accountability**: Increased reviewer accountability for quality feedback
- **Transparency**: Greater transparency in the review process
- **Recognition**: Proper recognition for reviewer contributions
- **Learning**: Educational value for the scholarly community
